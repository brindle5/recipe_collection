### Github projects

I used  [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/brindle5/recipe_collection/projects) as an Agile tool. I created user stories, issues, and milestone tasks which were tracked on a basic kanban board.

I also used [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/brindle5/recipe_collection/issues) as an another Agile tool. I created my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories which I allocated to milestone iterations.
