## Code Validation

### HTML

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS file which passes with no errors. The report can be found [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-kitchen.herokuapp.com).

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate the small amount of JavaScript code I’ve used.

## Defensive Programming

## User Story Testing

All of my site's features fulfil the needs set out in my user stories:

As a site user, I can upload my recipes so that I can keep a permanent record of them.
